# longest_common_prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

#C++
using the vector<string> and compare the letter with the first word one by one.

#Java
Firstly,put the word into the prefix,if there is no substring in the other word,pre-1.
the String function is:String[].indexof(substring);
                       String.substring(beign,end);   //parameter is int

Sadly,when I use my C++'s method in Java,no AC,and I don't konw why.
